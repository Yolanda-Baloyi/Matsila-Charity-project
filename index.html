        <h2>About Matsila Youth Development Forum (MYDF)</h2>
        <p>
          MYDF seeks to minimize the challenges that the learners of Ridokona Day Care Center, Matsila Primary and Radzambo Secondary School face and to provide motivation for them to perform at their best, with the minimal resources available to them.

We provide career guidance, information on alternate funding for further education and we also raise funds for the different needs the schools have from time to time. We also host an Awards event for our Top Achievers bi-annual. As members of the MYDF, we fund and raise funds for the initiatives we would like to implement.

The members of the forum are residents of the area and know the conditions first hand and instead of waiting for the development to come to them, they have decided to pro-actively pursue a better life for the students and the people of the village.

Development in these areas continues to move at a snail pace and this can be attributed to the lack of capacity in many of the previously deprived communities of South Africa. Employment opportunities are non-existent and this compels many young people to migrate to other parts of the country in search of jobs. The consequence of this migration is the erosion of skills since many of the young people with potential are driven far away from their communities. Ha Matsila is also not able to attract skilled people as it has nothing to offer in terms of opportunities. There is therefore no prospect for growth and development and limited chance of social cohesiveness.

One of the legacies inherited from the apartheid system is the absence of the science, technology and finance subjects in the local Radzambo Secondary School. In its entire history the Radzambo Secondary School has never offered these subjects. Young people with an interest in these subjects are compelled to register in schools situated in other villages where these subjects are taught. Many are forced to walk about 15 Kilometers a day to schools that offer science, technology and finance. Mr Simangele Nanjee, one of the founder members of the MYDF, had to walk about 14 Kilometers to the Ramauba Secondary School at Tshikwarani village in order to do the science subjects in Grade 12. Many of the young people of Ha Matsila, the girls in particular, are trapped in this situation of limited career choices. The limitations have over the years compelled some young people to drop out of school as they became disillusioned. The lack of development at Ha Matsila and surrounding villages can also be attributed to the limitation in the number of young people with competency in the fields of science, technology, engineering and finance.
