            <p class="image-content">The school serves the disadvantaged community of Matsila Village, in the Limpopo
              province. The school was
              established in 1987 and never had a Matric Dance for the students. Class of 2013 was given a special
              send-off into the world on the 12th October 2013. Matsila Youth Development Forum raised money to provide
              an
              unforgettable evening to the 15 Matric students as well as their parents at a nearby lodge (Joe Matsila
              Lodge). For more pictures, please visit our <a

            <p>The campaign was about raising funds to renovate the toilets of Radzambo Secondary School. The toilets
              were build in 1986 and were totally dilapidated. Our goal was to improve the lives of the toilet-less
